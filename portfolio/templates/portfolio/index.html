            <p>
              Hi, my name is Tianxin(Kerstin) YU and I am a design researcher. I have a passion for linking design, cognitive science and technology together to create better learning experiences for children and make education more universally accessible. I have been organizing many charitable projects focused on education equity in rural China. My hope is that using cutting-edge educational techniques could be a new powerful way to promote education in the third world.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am currently a student in Department of Industrial Design at Tsinghua University as well as a part-time research assistant in the Motor control and Virtual Reality lab at Peking University. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and a dual degree in Art Studies from Peking University.
            </p>

              Outside of academia, I enjoy traveling, snowboarding and gym training. I once achieved 8th place in an alpine snowboarding competition in Beijing，China，despite the fact that there were only eight players attending the last run ;)
