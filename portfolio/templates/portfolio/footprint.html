      <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">A Fact About CMU Students (Myself included)</h4>
      <p>
        How late do CMU students stay on campus? What is the average sleep time? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier this year, I was helping Professor David Creswell from psychology department clean and visualize student data on lifestyle. They collected sleep data from 170 CMU first-year students across the spring semester 2017. The data showed that more than half of the students had at least stayed on campus until midnight for a few times, which is pretty common among my cohort too. But this is not the most impressive result. The data also showed that CMU students went to bed around 1:30 am on average and got up around 9:00 am - Perfectly 7.5 hours of sleep in a not-so-healthy way. And I realized Iâ€™ve been a typical example.

    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>
      As we all know, life at CMU is hectic and full of hard work. Most of our time is either at home or campus. Also, a lot of people stay late and leave the campus at midnight, which is very unhealthy. We all want to change our lifestyle to a healthy pattern. However, we may not be aware of our daily life and find excuses for ourselves as "It will be the last time I go home this late." or "I will go out and relax a little bit this weekend." In most cases, it is no more than a placebo. So, in this project byte, I want to collect my location data for the whole month and monitor my daily activities. I hope to know my "footprints" in Pittsburgh regarding sequential geometry information, accumulated data, and data segments by the period during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Footprint project is one of my ideas to monitor my lifestyle through phone sensors. I collected data like GPS, screen status, and motion, and analyse these data regularly to raise awareness of my unhealthy lifestyle. I will share some of my GPS data with you in the following section.
    </p>

    <h3>MY FOOT PRINTS</h3>
    <p>
      The first map shows the places I have been during the first month in spring. It is obvious that I have spent most of my time at home or campus. One exception is Feb. 4th. I went to spring sevens and spent a nice day snowboarding there. (zoom out to view the whole dataset)

    <h3>TIME I SPENT</h3>
    <p>
      The following map shows my location data in different time segments during the day, from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm/ 0:00 am. If you choice the period from 10 pm to 12 pm,  you will find that about 1/3 of the days that I was at the campus. It is not that worse, actually, 
      probably better than your data? Still, the story would be different if we take samples from U Pitts as a reference.....LOL.

    <h3>PLACES I STAY</h3>
    <p>
      The following map is a heat map that shows my accumulated location data. I cleaned out the snowboarding day to make this dataset more representative. The places I spend most of my time were my home, Gates, NSH, FMS building, and the bus stop.
      I assume that there would be a big red spot for the gym. However, I spent quite a lot time to find it .....

    <h3>REAL-TIME MONITOR</h3>
    <p> 
      Here is the real-time monitor of my location. There maybe some delay since I might not be able to sync my data to google cloud without wifi. 
      If you find me stay at campus at midnight, it would be nice to send me a message and push me go home....
