                This study is aimed to examine the association between academic possible selves and proactive coping behavior among elementary school children. We assume that the cognitive and emotional changes that possible selves bring to children might affect their proactive coping behavior. The first study used laboratory priming and a structured intervention to help students examine their possible selves. The experiment group had a more positive and detailed possible selves. After the intervention, students were required to take social implicit cognition tests regarding their attitude towards school education. The study found that academic burnout among the experiment group (N=92) was significantly lower than the control group, as well as that their implicit attitude toward school education was more positive. To further explore the long-term effect of this intervention, and its association with proactive coping behaviors, we conducted cross-sectional research based on self-reported surveys. 142 student from migrant families participated in this one year study. Results from Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) support a mediating model in which 1) academic burnout could negatively predict their coping behavior, 2) Mediation effect analysis showed that this prediction was full mediated by self-efficacy, and 3) Social support could partially moderate this prediction.

                Sensory substitution systems, by captivating neural plasticity, can provide individuals sensory information via a sensory channel different from the channel normally used. This "substituted" sensory information can benefit people with various types of sensory deficiency. Vibrotactile stimulators are widely used in tactile sensory substitution. However, tactile perception is prone to various potential illusions, especially when there are multiple stimuli sources presented in spatiotemporal vicinity. The present study employed psychophysical methods to investigate three illusions elicited by an array of vibrotactile stimulators. Our study consisted of 4 experiments to evaluate vibrotactile perception on the forearm. In Experiment 1, a forced-choice method was used to investigate the effects of stimulus duration, (physic) distance and stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) on the numeration of multiple stimuli presented in a sequence. We found that the physical distance between stimuli had no significant effect; instead, the perceived number of stimuli was positively correlated with SOA and the ratio between SOA and duration (I/D). In Experiment 2 to 4, we used an array of three stimulators to investigate how the perception of stimulus numeration, position and magnitude is modulated by I/D levels. In Experiment 2, we measured the psychophysical curve between I/D and the perceived number of stimulus and derived the linear relationship between them. Experiment 3 adopted the same experimental protocol as Experiment 2 but used a virtual-position learning paradigm to investigate the positional illusion, i.e., the location biased of perceived stimulus. We demonstrated that I/D had significant and systematic effects on this illusion, in addition to the biased numeration effect. Experiment 4 took this one step further and used a pressure-sensitive tablet to study the influence of I/D on masking effect. We identified that participants experienced both positional illusions and biased perception of stimulus magnitude.

                Our study systematically investigated and quantified diverse illusions induced by arrays of vibrotactile stimulators with (or by varying) varying spatiotemporal relationship. Our findings provided a solid psychophysical foundation for designing vibrotactile sensory substitution systems.

                This study presents the preliminary exploration of a sensory feedback system for providing Center of Pressure (CoP) feedback to amputees. The CoP dis- placements in mediolateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions are classified into different directional patterns, and we expressed these patterns with combinations of four pancake vibrators placed around the thigh. A pilot test was performed first to determine the stimulation threshold value that could be perceivable by the subjects. Two experiments including location and amplitude discrimination were then performed to determine the best stimulation parameters for pattern discrimination,  and the average accurate recognition rates of 12 subjects were 99.3% and 97.7%, respectively. Based on the determined parameters, pattern discrimination experiments were performed to discriminate 12 patterns with different directional cueing, and experiments with 7 subjects achieved an accurate recognition rate of 95.4%.
